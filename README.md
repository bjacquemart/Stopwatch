# Stopwatch

Use a .NET reactive observable to create a simple stopwatch because I needed one:)

## How To Use the Stopwatch


C:\>stopwatch

Press [Enter] to start [L] to lap and [Esc] to stop the stopwatch...
elapsed time: 00:00:04, current local time: 1/31/2014 10:26:37 AM -06:00
lap 1, 00:00:02
lap 2, 00:00:01

C:\Debug>
